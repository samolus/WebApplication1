# WebApplication1
WebSite of Samuel A and Julien B, this WebSite is a school project with no commercial purposes. 

This project was to initiate ourselves to the Web Programmation. We had to develop a full-stack Website with the MVC pattern, an ORM andÂ CRUD actions.

We choose to create this Website with the ASP.NET framework.
We use C#, HTML and CSS.
